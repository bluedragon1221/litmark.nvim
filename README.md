Create a literate config in Neovim!

## Backstory
The one thing that I have always envied about emacs is the ability to create a literate config.
In emacs, this means that your configuration file is written in orgmode, and code written in codeblocks is sourced.
This plugin attempts to do something similar (but with markdown).
